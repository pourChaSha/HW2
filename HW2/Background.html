  <h1>Background</h1>
  <p></p>    
  <h4><strong>W</strong>here do I begin?</h4>
  <p>My name is Charue Aiesha Short.  My Web and Software Developer's career has begun.  I don't know if I should enjoy it, but I <strong>know</strong> that I do.  There is a long story of how I got here.  Finally...   
  </p>
  <p>I am about 30 credits from an Accounting degree, it was the smart way to go, but there is a story to that as well.  I studied Network Support and did not like that side of Information Technology.  Technical, helpdesk and customer support are a few titles held.  I have worked in the government, telecommunications, financial, and healthcare sectors.  What does working only for the Fortune 500 tell you about <em>me</em>?
